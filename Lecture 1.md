# Lecture 1

In this Lecture we talked about how to Install VS Code and How to become a successful Web Developer.

## Basic Structure of HTML

We Learnt about Basic Structure of HTML Which looks like 

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```
We can directly generate the basic structure of HTML by using Emmet Abbreviation. 

When we type `!` in a HTML file to get basic structure.

_Emmet abbreviations are a syntax used to quickly write HTML, XML, and CSS code._

## How do Websites Work?

Websites work through a Server - Client model. In a Server Client Model, There are 2 Main Components :-

1. Client- A software installed on User's device via which he can send a request to the Server. It's role is to initiate communication by sending a request to a server for a specific service or data.  For Example: Browsers like Chrome, Brave, Firefox, Edge, etc

2. Server- A server is a a powerful computer or software program that is always running, waiting for and responding to requests from clients. It's role is to process client requests and provide the requested data or services, such as web pages, files, or information

## Role of Browser

Browser's main function is to retrieve, interpret, and display content from the internet and local networks. It acts as a client, sending HTTP requests for webpages, images, videos, and other files from web servers. The browser then translates the underlying code (like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) into the visual, interactive content users see on their screens. 

## Difference between Frontend and Backend

1. Frontend: 
Frontend is the user-facing part of a website or application, handling what users see and interact with, including the visual design and layout, often using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

2. Backend: Backend is the invisible server-side infrastructure that supports the frontend by managing data, handling business logic, and ensuring the application functions smoothly, utilizing databases, servers, and programming languages like Python or Node.js
