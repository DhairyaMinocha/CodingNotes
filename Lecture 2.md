# Lecture 2
In this Lecture we learnt some basic stuff in HTML, CSS, JS.

## HTML
In the basic structure of a HTML:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: It Specifies that the Document is a HTML document.

- `<html lang='en'>`: It Specifies that the Document is in English.
- `<head>`: Head tag in HTML serves as a container for metadata about the HTML document. 


## CSS
 To link a CSS file to HTML, you have to link it via `<script src="script.js"></script>` in HTML. 

 - `body {}` is a selectory used to target and apply styles to the `<body>` tag in HTML. Properties used today are:
     - ``` 
        body{
         background-color: red;
         color: white;
        } 
        ``` 
        This Snippet is used to set background color of `<body>` to Red and Text color to White.
 
## JS
 
We learnt that JS is linked to HTML using `<script src="script.js"></script>` under `<head>` tag.

- `alert()` in JS is used to send a Text Popup in the HTML page.
