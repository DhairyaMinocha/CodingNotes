## HTML
In the basic structure of a HTML:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```
- `<meta>`: Meta Tag in HTML stores the metadata about the webpage which is used for SEO Optimizations in Web Browsers.
- `<title>`: Title Tag in HTML contains the Title of the HTML Document.
- `<body>`: Body Tag in HTML serves as a container for all the Content in the HTML FIle.
